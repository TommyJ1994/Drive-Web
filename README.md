### Drive - The Open Car Network ###

* The project idea is to create a form of “Social Network” that is focused on providing an easy way for users to extract their car data and then view their car data in the cloud whilst contributing to an anonymous data network that can be used for research purposes and many other uses. The project involves monitoring 30+ car sensors and creating 2 applications – an Android mobile application used to extract data from the car over Bluetooth/ISO9141-2 and a web based telemetrics application responsible for graphing a driver’s car data as well as generating key statistics using pattern matching. All cars built after 1996 will be supported in the project.
